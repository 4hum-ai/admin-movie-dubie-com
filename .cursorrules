# Cursor Rules for Admin UI

## 1. MANDATORY Development Workflow for AI

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: NO EXCEPTIONS - HUMAN APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR ALL WORK**

### Workflow Steps (MUST BE FOLLOWED IN ORDER):

1. **ðŸ“‹ PLAN PHASE** (MANDATORY - NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT THIS)
   - Create detailed plan with todos using `todo_write` tool
   - Break down task into specific, actionable items
   - Include estimated complexity and dependencies
   - Present plan to human for approval
   - **WAIT FOR EXPLICIT HUMAN APPROVAL** before proceeding

2. **âœ… APPROVAL CHECKPOINT** (MANDATORY)
   - Human must explicitly approve the plan
   - If human requests changes, revise plan and re-present
   - Only proceed to implementation after receiving approval

3. **ðŸ”¨ IMPLEMENT PHASE** (Only after approval)
   - Follow the coding conventions and architecture patterns outlined below
   - Update todos as work progresses
   - Mark completed todos as done

4. **ðŸ§ª TEST PHASE** (If needed)
   - Add unit tests for new functionality when appropriate
   - Update todos to reflect testing status

5. **ðŸ“š DOCS PHASE** (If needed)
   - Update relevant documentation if changes affect system architecture or usage
   - Update todos to reflect documentation status

6. **ðŸ’¾ COMMIT PHASE** (MANDATORY - Final Step)
   - Create descriptive commit message following conventional commit format
   - Push to github

## 2. Architecture & Patterns

### Architecture Map

- Entry: `src/main.ts` (Pinia, Router, Theme init)
- Routing: `src/router/index.ts`
- State: `src/stores/auth.ts`
- API Service: `src/composables/useResourceService.ts`
- API gateway: `src/utils/useApiGateway.ts` (fetch + Firebase token)
- CDN service: `src/composables/useCdn.ts` (load files from CDN instead of origin)
- Media players: `src/components/organisms/VideoPlayer.vue`, `src/components/organisms/AudioPlayer.vue`
- Image optimization: Use `<Image>` component for optimization and image transformation
- Views: `src/views/ItemListView.vue`, `src/views/ItemDetailView.vue`
- Shared components in atomic design: `src/components/{atoms,molecules,organisms,templates}`

### Design Patterns

- **Composition API**: Use `<script setup lang="ts">` exclusively
- **Atomic Design**: Strict component hierarchy (atoms â†’ molecules â†’ organisms â†’ templates)
- **Service Layer**: All API calls through `useResourceService` composables
- **State Management**: Pinia stores for global state, local state in components
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## 3. Coding Conventions

### Language & Framework
- Language: TypeScript, Vue 3 SFC `<script setup lang="ts">`
- State: Pinia stores under `src/stores/*`
- Composables: `src/composables/*` return plain functions/objects and avoid side effects on import
- Styling: Tailwind classes only; do not add global CSS unless in `src/style.css`
- API: Use `useResourceService` methods; do not fetch directly in components
- CDN: Use `useCdn()` composable to load files from CDN instead of origin
- Media: Use `VideoPlayer` and `AudioPlayer` components for media playback with CDN by default.
- Images: Use `<Image>` component for optimization and image transformation
- Routing: `src/router/custom.ts` for custom routes and `src/router/generic.ts` for generic routes that support low-code backend
- Icons: Use `unplugin-icons` with mdi iconset `@iconify-json/mdi`

### Component Development
- Use atomic design principles strictly
- Props should be typed with interfaces: `defineProps<PropsInterface>()`
- Emit events with proper typing: `defineEmits<EmitsInterface>()`
- Use `ref()` and `reactive()` appropriately for state
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Use `watch()` and `watchEffect()` for side effects

### Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks in composables and async functions
- Surface errors via `useToast.push()` with appropriate severity levels
- Log errors to console in development mode
- Handle network errors gracefully with retry logic
- Provide fallback UI for error states
- Never use `alert()` or `console.error()` for user-facing errors

### Performance
- Use `v-memo` for expensive list rendering
- Implement proper loading states with skeleton loaders
- Lazy load heavy components with `defineAsyncComponent()`
- Optimize images with proper sizing and lazy loading
- Use `shallowRef()` for large objects that don't need deep reactivity
- Debounce search inputs and API calls
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for composables and utilities (Vitest)
- Component tests for complex interactions (Vue Test Utils)
- Integration tests for API flows
- E2E tests for critical user journeys (Playwright)

### Test Structure
- Tests in `tests/unit/` directory
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names and organize with `describe()` blocks

## 5. Code Quality

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types without explicit justification
- Use proper type guards and assertions
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use generic types for reusable components

### Code Organization
- One component per file
- Group related composables together
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) for clean imports
- Keep files under 300 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Documentation
- JSDoc comments for complex functions
- README updates for architectural changes
- Inline comments for business logic
- Type definitions serve as documentation

## 6. Security & Best Practices

### Security
- Sanitize user inputs
- Validate API responses
- Use proper authentication tokens
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Never expose sensitive data in client code

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Maintain color contrast ratios
- Test with screen readers

### Performance Monitoring
- Use browser dev tools for performance analysis
- Monitor bundle size and loading times
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use service workers for offline functionality
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

## 7. AI Collaboration Guidelines

### ðŸŽ¯ MANDATORY AI BEHAVIOR
- **ALWAYS** start with planning phase using `todo_write` tool
- **ALWAYS** wait for explicit human approval before any implementation
- **ALWAYS** explain what you're about to do before doing it
- **ALWAYS** ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous
- **NEVER** assume you have permission to proceed
- **NEVER** skip the approval checkpoint

### Communication
- Always explain the reasoning behind code decisions
- Provide context for complex implementations
- Suggest alternatives when appropriate
- Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requirements
- **Explicitly state when you're waiting for approval**

### Code Generation
- Generate complete, runnable code
- Include proper error handling
- Add appropriate TypeScript types
- Follow the established patterns in the codebase
- Provide examples for complex usage
- **Only generate code after receiving explicit approval**

### Review Process
- Always review generated code before implementation
- Test functionality thoroughly
- Ensure consistency with existing codebase
- Update documentation as needed
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios

### ðŸš¨ COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT
- If you catch yourself about to implement without approval, STOP immediately
- If you realize you skipped the planning phase, STOP and restart with planning
- If human asks you to do something, respond with "I'll create a plan for that and wait for your approval"
- Always use phrases like "I'm waiting for your approval to proceed" or "Please approve this plan so I can continue"

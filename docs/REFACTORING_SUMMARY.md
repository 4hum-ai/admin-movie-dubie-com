# Refactoring Summary: Separating Backend Resource Types into Models

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring work done to separate backend resource types from general utility types in the studio project.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Created New Models Directory

- **Location**: `src/models/`
- **Purpose**: Contains domain entities and business logic types

### 2. New Model Files Created

#### `BaseEntity.ts`

- Common fields used across all domain entities
- `id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `createdBy`, `updatedBy`

#### `User.ts`

- User domain model with role and status types
- Extends `BaseEntity`
- Fields: name, email, role, status, avatar, phone, timezone, language, organizationId, etc.

#### `Organization.ts`

- Organization domain model with type and status types
- Extends `BaseEntity`
- Fields: name, type, status, email, website, phone, country, address, companySize, industry, etc.

#### `Title.ts`

- Title domain model for movies, series, episodes, documentaries
- Extends `BaseEntity`
- Fields: name, type, status, description, year, director, duration, genre, language, rating, etc.

#### `Media.ts`

- Media domain model for files and assets
- Extends `BaseEntity`
- Fields: fileName, type, format, status, language, fileSize, duration, resolution, etc.

#### `Contact.ts`

- Contact domain model for contact information
- Extends `BaseEntity`
- Fields: name, email, phone, role, department, status, address, city, state, country, etc.

#### `index.ts`

- Exports all models for easy importing

### 3. What Stayed in Types Directory

The following utility types remain in `src/types/` as they are not domain entities:

- **`common.ts`** - Generic utility types (DataItem, ActionItem, FormData, etc.)
- **`ui-config.ts`** - UI configuration interfaces for admin interface
- **`query.ts`** - Query parameter types for API operations
- **`events.ts`** - Event bus types and payloads
- **`toast.ts`** - Toast notification types

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Models: Business domain entities
   - Types: UI configuration and utility types

2. **Better Organization**
   - Domain models are grouped together
   - Easier to find and maintain business logic types

3. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Changes to domain models don't affect UI types
   - Clear boundaries between different type categories

4. **Consistency with Studio2**
   - Follows the same pattern as the newer studio2 project
   - Establishes consistent architecture across projects

## Usage Examples

### Importing Models

```typescript
// Import specific models
import type { User, Organization, Title } from '@/models'

// Import all models
import * as Models from '@/models'
```

### Type Safety

```typescript
// Strongly typed user data
const user: User = {
  id: '123',
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  role: 'admin',
  status: 'active',
  createdAt: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z',
  updatedAt: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z',
}

// Type-safe organization operations
function updateOrganization(org: Organization, updates: Partial<Organization>) {
  // TypeScript will ensure only valid fields can be updated
}
```

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes to existing code
- All existing imports from `@/types/*` continue to work
- New models can be imported from `@/models/*`
- Existing utility types remain in their current locations

## Future Considerations

1. **Validation**: Consider adding runtime validation to models using libraries like Zod or Joi
2. **Relationships**: Models could be enhanced with relationship definitions
3. **Methods**: Consider adding business logic methods to models if needed
4. **Testing**: Models can now be easily unit tested in isolation

## Conclusion

This refactoring successfully separates backend resource types from utility types, creating a cleaner and more maintainable codebase structure. The new models directory provides a clear home for domain entities while keeping utility types organized in their appropriate locations.
